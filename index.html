            <strong>Anonymus</strong> - Review of Ocean Breeze Hotel<br>I spent a week at the Ocean Breeze Hotel in Greece and I was enjoyed! This hotel very large and it was on the seafront and modern.
<br>
This hotel has got 155 rooms, there're tree swimming pools and one swimming pool on rooftop, laundry service, two big restaurants with delicious, and tiny gym outdoor. My room is not large, but it is clean and comfy. The WiFi was very fast, but I bought a greek SIM-card in hotel shop.
<br>
But this hotel have some mini problems. No wake-up call. And I need to pay for room service. Some days, I cleaned my room. I also woke up after 9 AM and  sometimes missed breakfasts..
<br>
It was some probloms, but I enjoyed my stay. I highly recommend this hotel for people who wants to have a rest and pay not much. This is the best hotel which I visited ever (because I never visited other hotels)!
