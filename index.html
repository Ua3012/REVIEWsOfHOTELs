            <strong>Anonymus</strong> - Review of Ocean Breeze Hotel<br>Last summer, I stayed at Ocean Breeze Hotel in Santorini, Greece, for five nights. The location was perfect—right by the sea, with breathtaking sunrise views. The booking process was smooth, and check-in was quick and friendly.</br><br>I really enjoyed the hotel's rooftop pool and spa, which provided a relaxing experience after a day of exploring. The rooms were modern, clean, and spacious, with a balcony overlooking the ocean. The restaurant was also fantastic, offering a variety of fresh fruits, pastries, and Greek specialties.</br><br>However, there were some downsides. The Wi-Fi was slow, making it difficult to work or stream videos. Additionally, room service took too long, sometimes over an hour.</br><br>This hotel is a nice place to rest and enjoy nature. It has great views and comfy rooms, but service can be a bit slow.</br>
